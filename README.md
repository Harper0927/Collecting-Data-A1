##Introduction
Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services worldwide. One of the reason why it is loved by most is because of its amazing collection of playlists. It also gives an option to surf through Top 50 songs charts which are widely used by users. 
Therefore, I would like to choose Spotify as the music platform to extract data and present the dataset in "Top 50 songs by Country."
##Researche Question
The aim of this project is to discuss:Whether people from different continents share same music preference or not?
##Project Design and Implementation
The study population will be chosen from nine countries, each three from a different continent: Europe, North America, and South America.
The dataset contains 8 columns :
Country - Country name
Continent - Continent name
Rank - Rank of song on particular country chart
Title - Title of song
Artists - Artists involved in song
Album - Album name of song
Explicit - If song is explicit or not?
Duration - Duration of song
##Project extension
This dataset can help analyze the musical tastes of various nations. For explicit content, preferences include likeability and duration. It can also be used to monitor the impact of music from one country on another and determine how well-liked a particular musician is.
